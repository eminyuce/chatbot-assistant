                                A Java Spring Boot-based Chatbot Assistant powered by a locally running Large Language Model (LLM) using Ollama, and integrated with Spring AI.
                                                                
                                This assistant intelligently detects user intent and responds with context-aware information, such as weather updates or stock prices. Designed for flexibility, it supports two distinct service modes to enable experimentation and extendability.
